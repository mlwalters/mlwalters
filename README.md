## Iâ€™m currently working on
 
- [Recipe Manager](https://github.com/mlwalters/recipeManager) A full-stack recipe manager using React on the front-end that consumes a C#/.NET RESTful Web API for the back-end, using Entity Framework Core and SQLServer for the database and Swagger UI. 
- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/): Introduction to SQL Server 

## My Projects
#### Full-stack/Back-End
- [Organizely E-Planner (March 1, 2021 - April 26, 2021)](https://github.com/AKA-Liftoff-Group-2021/Organizely-App): A dynamic web application, built with C#/.NET RESTful Web API for the back-end and Angular 11 for the front-end, using SQLite for the database, and JSON web tokens for authentication to help students manage time and organize tasks, designed with simple but practical features. This is a group capstone project I worked on with 3 other LaunchCode graduates. 
- [TechJobs (Persistent edition)](https://github.com//mlwalters/TechJobsPersistent): A C#/.NET web app using MVC design pattern that can search and list(lookup) jobs with Bootstrap, using persistent database (MySQL) with authentication and CRUD functionality
- [Coding Events](https://github.com/mlwalters/codingEvents-authentication): A C#/.NET web app using MVC design pattern with EF Core, a persistent database (MySQL) with authentication and CRUD functionality, and the Identity package for authorization where you can add coding events with categories linked to each event
- [Payment Detail App](https://github.com/mlwalters/angular11dotnet5-paymentDetailApp): An Angular 11 web app that consumes a Web API built using C#/.NET5, Bootstrap, with SQLServer as database provider. I followed a tutorial for this to review Angular and learn to consume an API using HTTP requests, and mostly learn to build a web API as preparation for my capstone project (Organizely E-Planner).

#### Front-End 
- A LaunchCode Codergirl assignment, a webpage to demonstrate HTML/CSS skills [Live](https://mlwalters.github.io/html-me-something) | [Repo](https://github.com/mlwalters/html-me-something)
- A website with activities you can do during quarantine using HTML/CSS [Live](https://mlwalters.github.io/stay-at-home/) | [Repo](https://github.com//mlwalters/stay-at-home)
- A booklist app that also stores data to local storage using HTML/CSS/JavaScript [Live](https://mlwalters.github.io/booklist-app/) | [Repo](https://github.com//mlwalters/booklist-app)
- A to-do web app that stores data to local storage using HTML/CSS/JavaScript [Live](https://mlwalters.github.io/todo-webapp/) | [Repo](https://github.com//mlwalters/todo-webapp)
- freeCodeCamp sample portfolio [Live](https://mlwalters.github.io/freeCodeCamp-portfolio/) | [Repo](https://github.com//mlwalters/fcc-portfolio)

##### Some of my older front-end projects (when I first started coding)
- One of my first projects to demonstrate what I have learned with web design principles & responsiveness [Live](https://mlwalters.github.io/recipe-page/) | [Repo](https://github.com//mlwalters/recipe-page)
- A website for a made-up company [Codepen](https://codepen.io/carrimaxx/full/YzwGmGp)
- A sample technical documentation page [Codepen](https://codepen.io/carrimaxx/full/eYJBMKr)
- A sample survey form [Codepen](https://codepen.io/carrimaxx/full/dyYbyVd)
